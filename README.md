# Hangman Game

Hangman in the command line
  Python

Pulled list of words from (https://github.com/first20hours/google-10000-english/blob/master/google-10000-english-no-swears.txt)

Sets up basic gallows illustration and variable declarations

Asks for a guess (and checks for valid entry)

If guess is valid, updates game states based on correctness

Reprints gallows after update and prompts for next guess

Ends game after word is found or hangman is drawn

Asks if you want to replay
  If yes reset, else quit
